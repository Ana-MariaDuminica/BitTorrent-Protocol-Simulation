# BitTorrent-Protocol-Simulation
Distributed file-sharing system simulating the BitTorrent protocol using MPI and Pthreads.
Implemented a tracker-client architecture for dynamic segment sharing, optimizing downloads via peer
availability and load balancing. Designed multi-threaded clients for efficient upload/download
synchronization and data integrity management.
